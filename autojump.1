.SH NAME
autojump \- a faster way to navigate your filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" Syntax goes here. 
.B j 
dirspec
.P
.B jstat
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B autojump
is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line. The 
.B jstat
command shows you the current contents of the database. You need to work a little bit before the database becomes useable. Once your database is reasonably complete, you can "jump" to a directory by typing:
.P
.B j
dirspec
.P
where dirspec is a few characters of the directory you want to jump to. It will jump to the most used directory whose name matches the pattern given in dirspec.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B j
mp3
.P
could jump to /home/gwb/my\ mp3\ collection, if that is the directory in which you keep your mp3s.
.SH BUGS
No known bugs at this time.
