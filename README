AUTOJUMP - A faster way to navigate your filesystem
===================================================



One of the most used shell commands is "cd". A quick survey among my friends revealed that between 10 and 20% of all commands they type are actually cd commands! Unfortunately, jumping from one part of your system to another with cd requires to enter almost the full path, which isn't very practical and requires a lot of keystrokes.

autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line. The jstat command shows you the current contents of the database. You need to work a little bit  before  the  database becomes useable. Once your database is reasonably complete, you can "jump" to a directory by typing:

       <b>j</b> dirspec

where dirspec is a few characters of the directory you want to jump to. It will jump to the most used  directory  whose
name matches the pattern given in dirspec.

EXAMPLES

       <b>j</b> mp3

could jump to "/home/gwb/my mp3 collection", if that is the directory in which you keep your mp3s.

       <b>jstat</b>

will print out something in the lines of:

       ...
       54.5:	/home/shared/musique
       60.0:	/home/joel/workspace/coolstuff/glandu
       83.0:	/home/joel/workspace/abs_user/autojump
       96.9:	/home/joel/workspace/autojump
       141.8:	/home/joel/workspace/vv
       161.7:	/home/joel
       Total key weight: 1077

The "key weight" reflects the amount of time you spend in a directory.

INSTALLATION

Auto Installation:
Just run ./install.sh 
It uses sudo, so it will probably prompt you for your root password. 
You stiill need to do: 
    source /etc/profile
in your .bashrc
If the script fails, you may need to do 
    chmod +x install.sh
before the first step. 

Manual installation of autojump is very simple: copy autojump to /usr/bin, autojump.sh to /etc/profile.d, and autojump.1 to /usr/share/man/man1. Make sure you source /etc/profile in your .bashrc:

    source /etc/profile

PACKAGING

For now I have packaged autojump for arch linux. It is available from the AUR. To install, type:

    yaourt -S autojump

I would be very interested by pacakges for other distros. If you think you can help me with the packaging, please contact me!
