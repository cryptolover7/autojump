	* Release v20:

    - Man page and --help has been overhauled to provide better documentation
    and usage scenarios.
    - Installation scripts now act dependent on current
    environmental settings.
    If run as root, will do a global install. Installation script also
    detects which version to install (bash or zsh) dependent on $SHELL.
    Both of these behaviors can be overrode using --local/--global or
    --bash/--zsh arguments.
    - Uninstallation script added, will remove both global and local
    installations but ignores database.
    - Symlinks can be preserved as database entries, refer to man page for
    more details.
    - This change log added to better help package maintainers keep track of
    changes between releases.
    - Miscellaneous bug fixes.
